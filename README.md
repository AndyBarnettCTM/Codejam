# Codejam
Your challenge: Using the swapi.co API create a ​*console app*​ that runs the Star Wars credits (randomly from any of the  7 films 
i.e. it should run different credits upon different runs) replacing character names with Meerkat names. 
A Meerkat name must appear at least once in each feed.

Your solution needs to be test-first so make sure you commit each one of your tests before you write the code that makes these pass 
(RED, GREEN, REFACTOR). 

When the time is up send us a link to your repo in the #codejam channel.
